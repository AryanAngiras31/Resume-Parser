# Resume Parser API

An intelligent, production-ready Resume Parsing API built with **FastAPI**. It leverages hybrid extraction techniques—combining high-speed text extraction with heavy-duty OCR—and utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform unstructured resumes into structured JSON data tailored for HRMS systems.

## Features

- **Hybrid Extraction Engine**: 
    - Uses `PyMuPDF4LLM` for fast markdown extraction from text-based PDFs.
    - Automatically falls back to **Marker OCR** for scanned PDFs and images (PNG/JPG).
- **LLM-Powered Structuring**: Uses the `instructor` library with `Llama-3.3-70b` (via Groq) to accurately map resume content to a strict Pydantic schema.
- **Domain Specific**: Fine-tuned prompts for the Indian IT job market (e.g., extracting CTC in LPA, standardizing qualifications like B-TECH/MCA).
- **Async Lifespan Management**: Loads heavy machine learning models into memory once at startup for high-performance inference.
- **Dockerized**: Includes all necessary system dependencies (Tesseract, Ghostscript, OpenCV) for easy deployment.


## Prerequisites

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (Recommended)
- **Groq API Key**: Required for the LLM extraction layer. Get it at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com/).

## Environment Variables

The application requires the following environment variable to function:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | Your API key for Groq Cloud (to access Llama 3 models). |

## Installation & Setup

### Using Docker (Recommended)

Docker handles all system-level dependencies like Tesseract and Ghostscript automatically.

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AryanAngiras31/Resume-Parser.git
   cd Resume-Parser
   ```

2. **Build and Run**:
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

### Local Setup

If running locally without Docker, you must install system dependencies first:

1. **Install System Dependencies**:
   - **Linux**: `sudo apt install tesseract-ocr ghostscript libgl1`
   - **macOS**: `brew install tesseract ghostscript`

2. **Install Python Packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Server**:
   ```bash
   export GROQ_API_KEY="your_key_here"
   uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
   ```

## API Usage

### Extract Resume Data

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/extract-resume`

**Request**:
- `file`: Multipart file (PDF, PNG, or JPG)

**Example with cURL**:
```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8080/api/v1/extract-resume' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
  -F 'file=@my_resume.pdf'
```

**Response**:
```json

```

## Architecture Note

The API utilizes a `lifespan` event to load OCR models into the global `converter_instance`. This ensures that the heavy weights for layout detection and text recognition are only loaded once, reducing request latency significantly after the initial boot.
